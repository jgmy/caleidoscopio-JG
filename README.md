# caleidoscopio-JG
A camera kaleidoscope made with processing.

## Library Requirements
You need Ketai to compile this app.

## How to build
Install APDE in your android phone. Download the "ketai" library and add it to your APDE libraries. Download or clone the code of this project in APDE and run it. It is a small download and will build very fast.

Alternatively, you can install Processing in your Windows/Linux/Mac computer. From within Processing IDE, install the Android Mode for processing and the Ketai Library and finally install the Android Build Tools from inside processing. The process involves downloading around 1.5 gigs of applications including Processing, Android Mode, Android Build Tools and even Gradle. It's frustrating to see how Android Tools for PC grew so huge.

## Pre-compiled binaries
You have a precompiled binary on the /bin directory of this repository.

Precompiled binaries are being served to Amazon Apps, Aptoide/Blockchainds, Getjar and SlideMe, also, but only Amazon Apps has approved them yet.

## Hardware Requirements
Runs on android with 1280x720 camera.

## Privacy police
The app does not send data over the network. We don't get your data.
